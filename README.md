In this challenge we are exploring the Speech Synthesis API  
that comes with most modern browsers.

The project is an app that will speak out loud the text written  
in the text box.

Features:  
* Multiple voices to choose from.  
* Speech rate can be manipulated.  
* Speech pitch can also be manipulated.
